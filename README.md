# Particle-Markov-chain-Monte-Carlo
Python implementation of Particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (PMCMC) algorithms  
Include codes that generate synthetic data and visualization code that plot the results

Three specific versions of PMCMC algorithms are implmented:  
Particle independent Metropolis Hastings (PIMH)  
Particle marginal Metropolis Hastings (PMMH) with Gaussian random walk proposal  
Particle Gibbs (PG)  

All algorithms use the most basic resampling scheme, multinomial resampling, in their sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) / particle filter components.
